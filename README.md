# Take-Home Project For Backend Development Track
## API Documentaion:
The API Docuentaton of this project can be accessed [here](API-DOCs.md)
## ➔ Project topic: 
Build and deploy a simple API backend that allows users to create, read, update and delete notes. It should include a login system and the ability to save notes to a remote database. This can be built using any popular framework of your choice e.g Node.js, Laravel, Django etc..
###
## ➔ Evaluation areas:
backend design/development concepts, web development frameworks, coding skills, problem-solving skills, debugging and testing skills, version control skills
###
➔ Tools: A backend framework of your choice
